## Executive Summary and Introduction {.smaller}

-   **Executive Summary:** The water insecurity data helps our team produce insightful maps of water resources and infrastructure nationwide in the US. These maps show socio-economic elements like housing and indoor plumbing that affect water use and needs. We integrate ACS data to help water resource managers and policymakers. This method would help identify vulnerable people and infrastructural needs.
-   **Introduction :** Effective water management and policymaking need to understand the intricate relationship between socio-economic factors and water supplies. Annually updated, the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) provides demographic, social, economic, and housing data. In the next sections, we will explain how to use this data and offer water infrastructure and accessibility findings, such as showing how home infrastructure age, indoor plumbing prevalence, and household income affect water accessibility and affordability. This report will show how mapped ACS data can inform targeted actions and strategic planning for sustainable water resource management and infrastructure.

## Methodology and Results {.smaller}

-   **Methodology :**

    This report examines spatial and temporal variations in global water insecurity using the 2022 and 2023 water_insecurity data sets.The report maps the spatial distribution of water resource insecurity for each year separately, focusing on differences in indoor plumbing availability between counties in the western and eastern United States Changes in plumbing insecurity were analysed by mapping changes at the county level from 2022 to 2023. Each county's plumbing condition was compared to the national average to identify areas with higher or lower levels of insecurity, and maps were used to visualize regional differences and deviations. In addition, a comparative bar chart analysis of the top 10 counties with the greatest changes revealed different local trends.
